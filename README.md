# DS-4002-Project-1
  This project utilizes topic modeling to investigate the top themes discussed in State of the Union addreses. It analyzes all State of the Union addresses as a whole, and also examines different eras in American history. The State of the Union Address is considered to be one of the most crucial tools for a president to set an agenda, shift public opinion, and reassure people in times of uncertainty [1]. It is the only time in any given year where the entire cabinet, every member of Congress, and supreme court gather in the same room. 
  The delivery of the State of the Union Address, previously called the Annual Message, has changed over the years [2]. In the 1790s, speeches were given before Congress. Thomas Jefferson then began the tradition of giving a written address which lasted until Woodrow Wilson [3]. The address further evolved as broadcasting and television provided an opportunity for the President to speak directly to the American people and rally support for his agenda [2].
